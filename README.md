# BetterSaveLoad
This is a simple mod that is partly inspired by the now-defunct Save Overhaul.

You can press F9 to quick load the latest save file, be it a quick save, manual save or auto save.

You can also press Ctrl + S to quick save and Ctrl + L to quick load.

Instead of the vanilla quick save function which overwrites the same save file, now there are incremental quick saves with unique file names.

By default, this mod will auto save before battles with a minimum number of participants.

You can adjust the maximum number of quick saves and battle auto saves as well as the minimum number of participants for battle auto saves, and you can choose to toggle save limits and battle auto saves altogether.

This mod requires:
- Harmony
- MCM

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
