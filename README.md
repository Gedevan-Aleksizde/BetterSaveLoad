# BetterSaveLoad
This is a simple mod that is partly inspired by the now-defunct Save Overhaul.

You can press F9 to quick load the latest save file, be it a quick save, manual save or auto save.

You can also press Ctrl + S to quick save and Ctrl + L to quick load.

Instead of the vanilla quick save function which overwrites the same save file, now there are incremental quick saves with unique file names.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
